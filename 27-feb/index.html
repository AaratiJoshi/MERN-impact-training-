        I know you:
        You are light as dreams,
        Tough as oak,
        Precious as gold,
        As poppies and corn,
        Or an old cloak:
        Sweet as our birds
        To the ear,
        As the burnet rose
        In the heat

         Just hit the enter key or if you want you can manually write the whole tag -->

         <!-- Now, the problem arises here is that as soon as we click on the keyword, the website will open on the same webpage but if in
           case you want to open the website in a new tab then you have to add a new attribute in the anchor tag I.e. “target".  -->
